# WordWizard-cpp
This program starts by loading a dictionary of 62,454 correctly spelled words from a file into a hash table, which dynamically adjusts its storage capacity to accommodate all the words.

Once the dictionary is loaded, the program asks the user to input a word. It then searches the hash table to check if the user's input matches any of the stored words. If it finds a match, the program confirms that the word is spelled correctly. If not, it provides a list of suggested spelling corrections to help the user get it right.
